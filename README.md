# pratikjankar-interview-prep-cs

A **learning-first, interview-focused CS portfolio** by **Pratik Jankar**â€”ideal for anyone starting from scratch and preparing for FAANG or top-tier software interviews.

This repository walks you through structured modules in **DSA â†’ OOP/LLD â†’ OS â†’ DBMS â†’ Networking â†’ System Design**, complete with runnable code, UML diagrams, SQL tuning examples, Wireshark captures, and a Dockerized capstone project. Each module is self-contained, allowing you to clone, experiment, and learn at your own pace.
